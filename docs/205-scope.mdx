Open education Policies can have different scopes depending on their main objective. In most cases we can observe dedicated OE/OER Policies, which focus exclusively on OE/OER.

However, there are policies which only include sections addressing OE/OER. Building on a classification developed by JRC following constellations can be observed:
 - Educational Policies with an OE/OER component
 - Openness policies with an OE/OER component
 - ICT policies with an OE/OER component
 - Labour market policies with an OE/OER component

The OE Policy Registry includes both dedicated OE Policies as well as other policies that include sections on OE/OER.
