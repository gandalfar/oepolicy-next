OE policy-making happens at different political levels.

Most policies can be found at governmental level. While in some countries education falls under the responsibility of the federal government, it is the responsibility of the states in other countries.

Policy-making is also a common approach for Universities and other Higher Education Institutions.

Multi-National policies occur less frequently, but like the recently adopted UNESCO Recommendation on OER can have a strong impact on the development of OE.
