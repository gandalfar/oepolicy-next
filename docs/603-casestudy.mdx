Beside Open Education policies, we are also interested in collecting case studies about policy making in the field
of education. The idea is that through case studies we can learn about the processes behind successful policy
initiatives, so to allow others to learn from what has been done, what worked well and what didn't.

Case studies can be about a specific policy (for example “How the OER initiative XYZ was designed and planned”),
about a policy-related activity (for example “How civil society advocated for OE policy in the country XYZ”), or about
a policy tool (for example “How were developed the policy guidelines XYZ”). In brief, anything that can help us and
the community to learn from others’ work!

You can either write a case study specifically for us (we will of course recognise your authorship) or send us an
existing case study (increasing its visibility).

If you are interested, please [contact us!](mailto:info@oerworldmap.org) We are looking forward to hearing from you!
