Open Education Policies are regulations and strategies, which foster
the development and implementation of Open Educational Practices,
including the creation and use of Open Educational Resources, by
governments, institutions and other organisations. They allocate
resources and orchestrate activities in order to increase access to as
well as quality, efficiency and innovation of education.

The OE Policy Hub fosters collaborative policymaking by promoting good
practices and high-quality resources, and bringing together experts,
advocates and organisations from all over the world.

The heart of the hub is the Open Education Policy Registry, an
evolving database which collects and classifies Open Education Policy
documents from all educational sectors and levels of governance around
the world.
