When looking at data collections, one should always keep in mind that “the map is not the territory”. Even though we are continuously working on making the OE Policy Registry as comprehensive and complete as possible, we cannot guarantee that all currently existing policies are actually included. We are therefore dealing with approximations, which are as precise as possible but not with scientific truth.

Providing data on a global scope needs to be a collective endeavour. If you are aware of policies, which are not included in the registry yet, please add it to the Registry or share it with us!

By clicking on the segments of the charts you will be directed to the related entries in the OE Policy Registry. This allows you to verify each chart directly. This functionality also makes it possible using the charts to browse through the provided data set. All search results can be drilled down in the policy registry by setting additional filters allowing you to receive insights specifically on your topic of interest. You can also directly search within the [OE Policy Registry](https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.%40type=%22Policy%22).
