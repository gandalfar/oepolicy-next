So, youâ€™ve progressed with your initiative, overcome several hurdles, and finally implemented your open policy?
Then please make sure to share your outcomes and experiences!

We are looking for policy documents and case studies. The more policies we record and the richer the data about
them, the deeper the insights we can gain from analysing the data.

Together, data and narratives will allow us to identify efficient strategies and to spread them for the sake
of learners and teachers worldwide. So please make sure to contribute both!
