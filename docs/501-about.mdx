The OE Policy Hub fosters collaborative policymaking by promoting good practices and high-quality resources as well as bringing together experts, advocates and organisations from all over the world.

The heart of the hub is the Open Education Policy Registry, an evolving database which collects and classifies Open Education Policy documents from all educational sectors and levels of governance around the world.

The OE Policy Hub supports the implementation of the UNESCO Recommendation in its goal to mainstream Open Education on a global scale. Is a project of the OER World Map, which is the most comprehensive data collection on actors and activities related to Open Education and Open Educational Resources. The OER World Map is being funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and provided by the North Rhine Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz).
