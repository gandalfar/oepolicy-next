The effectiveness of a policy is quite difficult to measure, but it can be stated that a policy is only effective, if it triggers or forsters additional activities such as  the implementations of projects, which ultimately lead to the provision of open learning materials and infrastructure or to the implementation of open educational practices.

By embedding the OE Policy Registry in the OER World Map it is possible to collect additional information about the context of a policy, e.g. by recording projects or services and linking them to policies if necessary.

Relating data from the registry with data from the World Map confirms that countries which do have many OE/OER policies do have many OER repositories as well.
