OE policies cover every educational sector, but due to its independent nature, the higher education sector has the largest number of policies. Schools normally do not tend to develop institutional policies, and most of the school level policies are developed at national or state level.

While a huge share of the included policies can be clearly assigned to a single education sector, many other policies are cross sectoral in the sense, that several sectors are regulated.
